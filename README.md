# Unity_Roll-a-ball_Game_GameJam2016
A completed Roll-a-ball Unity game with a simplified movement script for beginners.

Hi, 

  This is a completed tutorial for Unity's Roll-a-ball beginner tutorial, found here:
  
  https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial
  
  Since I couldn't find the scripts readily available online, I'm using github to distribute them to the beginners for the Code in the Schools Game Jam.
  
  One thing I don't like about the tutorial is that the movement script for the player is a little too advanced for beginners.
  
  I've added my own to this repository, which I think is more teachable for people just starting out. It's called "move simple1.cs" and it only includes the part of the script that controls movement, not the parts added later in the tutorial to keep track of the score. This is so beginners can clearly see what part of the script does what.
